# This project is based on the ATmeg32 Micro-controller With AMIT Kit.

## The main objective of this project is to enable and configure GPIO Ports On ATmega32.

### Tools

1. Eclipse With AVR Plugin.
2. Proteus Simulator.
3. Avr-gcc.

### Main PORTS That Are Used To Configure External Interrupts

1. PORTA With Registers (PORTA, DDRA, PINA).
2. PORTC with Registers (PORTC, DDRC, PINC).

### Main Goal For This Project:

1. Display Number from 0 to 99 at the two 7-segments.
2. Activate the 3-leds sequentially then turn on buzzer then return again.
