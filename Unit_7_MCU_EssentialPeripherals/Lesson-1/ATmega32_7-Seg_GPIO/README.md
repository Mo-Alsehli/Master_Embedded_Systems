## The main objective of this project is to enable and configure GPIO Ports On ATmega32.

### Tools

1. Eclipse With AVR Plugin.
2. Proteus Simulator.
3. Avr-gcc.

### Main PORTS That Are Used To Configure External Interrupts

1. PORTA With Registers (PORTA, DDRA, PINA).
2. PORTC with Registers (PORTC, DDRC, PINC).

### Main Goal For This Project:

1. Display Numbers from 0 to 99 in the two 7 segments.
2. Activate the 3-leds sequentially then turn on the buzzer then return again.
