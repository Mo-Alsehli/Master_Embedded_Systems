### This Is A Repo To Show How To Implement Data Structures (Stack, Queue and LinkedList With C Programming).

## Stack Implementation And Execution.

-Stack Depends On The Princple Last In First Out(LIFO)
-Main Functions Used In Stack.

```
1. Push
2. Pop
3. Get Top Item
4. Check If It's Empty
```

## Queue Implementation And Execution.

-Queue Depends On The Princple First In First Out(FIFO)
-Main Functions Used In Queue.

```
1. Enqueue
2. Dequeue
3. Check If It's Full
4. Print Queue
```

## LinkedList Implementation And Execution (DataBase Students).

-LinkedList Depends On The Princple Of Dynamic Allocation.
-Main Funcitons Used In LinkedList.

```
1. Add Student
2. Delete Student
3. View Students
4. Delete All
5. Get nth Node From First
6. linked List Length
7. Get nth Node From End
8. Get Mid Node In LinkedList
9. Detect Loop
10. Reverse LinkedList.
```
